## 📘 Overview

This project is **Task 2** of the **Data Analysis Internship at CODTECH**.  
The objective of this task is to build a Machine Learning model to predict outcomes based on a structured dataset.

The project is implemented using a **Python-based Jupyter Notebook**, where data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation are performed step by step.

This task demonstrates the ability to apply predictive modeling techniques and evaluate model performance effectively.
